I am a Ph.D. student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jing Li.  

My research focuses on **knowledge-informed machine learning**—developing methods that incorporate domain expertise to make models more data-efficient, robust, and interpretable. I explore how knowledge can be embedded at different stages of the learning pipeline:  

- **Representation level** – encoding qualitative knowledge into quantitative representations.  
- **Architecture level** – embedding knowledge into network design or loss function constraints.  
- **Inference level** – guiding model reasoning with explicit rules during prediction.  

These strategies are particularly relevant under **real-world data challenges** such as weak supervision, scarcity, and variability. My work applies these ideas to domains like **healthcare**, **precision agriculture**, and **manufacturing**, where integrating knowledge into machine learning can provide practical and socially impactful solutions.  

Outside research, I enjoy playing racquetball 🎾, knitting 🧶, and running 🏃‍♀️—activities that keep me balanced and often refresh my perspective.
