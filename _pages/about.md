Hello! Thank you for stopping by.
I am **Yeonju Lee**, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning <br> in the department of H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.  
My research interest focuses on knowledge-informed machine learning (ML) methods that integrate domain knowledge into data-driven models. Knowledge-informed ML can be applied in multiple domains such as  
- Healthcare (dental CBCT imaging)  
- Precision agriculture
- Manufacturing & Quality Control

that struggles with challenges such as data-scarcity, high-dimensionality, multi-modal data.
I have been working on focus on problems such as dental image analysis, forecasting, and anomaly detection, root cause analysis and control.
