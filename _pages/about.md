I am a Ph.D. student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jing Li.  

My research focuses on **knowledge-informed machine learning** under <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">real-world data challenges</span> such as <span style="color:#444;">weak supervision</span>, <span style="color:#444;">scarcity</span>, and <span style="color:#444;">variability</span>. In particular, I work on:  

- <span style="color:#3a5f8a;"><b>Weakly supervised learning</b></span> – leveraging incomplete or uncertain supervision.  
- <span style="color:#3a5f8a;"><b>Data-efficient learning</b></span> – achieving strong performance with limited data.  
- <span style="color:#3a5f8a;"><b>Multi-modal integration</b></span> – combining diverse sources of information for robust and interpretable models.  

These methods are broadly applicable, with particular relevance to **precision agriculture** and **medical imaging**, where addressing such challenges can directly advance practical and socially impactful AI solutions.  

Outside research, I enjoy playing racquetball 🎾, knitting 🧶, and running 🏃‍♀️—activities that keep me balanced and often refresh my perspective.
