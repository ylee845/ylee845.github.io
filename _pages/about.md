<div class="aboutme">

I am a Ph.D. student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at **Georgia Tech**, fortunate to be advised by <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">Prof. Jing Li</span>.  

My research focuses on <span style="color:#4169E1; font-weight:600">knowledge-informed machine learning</span>—developing methods that incorporate domain expertise to make models more *data-efficient*, *robust*, and *interpretable*. I explore how knowledge can be embedded at different stages of the learning pipeline:  

- **Representation level** – encoding qualitative knowledge into quantitative representations.  
- **Architecture level** – embedding knowledge into network design or loss function constraints.  
- **Inference level** – guiding model reasoning with explicit rules during inference.  

These strategies are particularly relevant under *real-world data challenges* such as **weak supervision**, **scarcity**, and **variability**. My work applies these ideas to domains like <span style="color:#4169E1; font-weight:600">healthcare</span>, <span style="color:#4169E1; font-weight:600">precision agriculture</span>, and <span style="color:#4169E1; font-weight:600">quality analytics in manufacturing</span>.  

Outside research, I enjoy playing racquetball 🎾, knitting 🧶, and running 🏃‍♀️—activities that keep me balanced and often refresh my perspective.
