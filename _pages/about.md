<div class="aboutme">
  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at 
    <strong>Georgia Tech</strong>, fortunate to be advised by <strong style="color:#4169E1;">Prof. Jing Li</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research focuses on <strong style="color:#4169E1;">knowledge-informed machine learning</strong>‚Äîdeveloping methods that incorporate domain expertise to make models more <em>data-efficient</em>, <em>robust</em>, and <em>interpretable</em>. 
    I develop methods to systematically integrate domain knowledge at different stages of the learning pipeline, tailored to the challenges posed by real-world data:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Representation level</strong> ‚Äì encoding qualitative knowledge into quantitative representations.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture level</strong> ‚Äì embedding knowledge into network design or loss function.</li>
    <li><strong>Inference level</strong> ‚Äì guiding model reasoning with explicit rules during inference.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These strategies are particularly relevant under <em>real-world data challenges</em> such as 
    <strong>scarcity</strong>, <strong>heterogeneity</strong>, and 
    <strong>high dimensionality</strong>. My work applies these ideas to domains like 
    <strong style="color:#4169E1;">healthcare</strong>, 
    <strong style="color:#4169E1;">precision agriculture</strong>, and 
    <strong style="color:#4169E1;">manufacturing</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Outside research, I enjoy playing racquetball üéæ, knitting üß∂, and running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äîactivities that keep me balanced and often refresh my perspective.
