Hello! Thank you for visiting my page.
I am Yeonju Lee, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research centers on knowledge-informed machine learning (ML)â€”approaches that integrate domain knowledge into data-driven models. This paradigm addresses challenges such as data scarcity, high dimensionality, and multi-modal integration, with applications across:
- Healthcare 
- Precision agriculture
- Manufacturing and quality control

I am particularly interested in problems involving dental image analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and control.
