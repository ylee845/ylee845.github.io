I am a Ph.D. student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at **Georgia Tech**, fortunate to be advised by <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">Prof. Jing Li</span>.  

My research focuses on <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">knowledge-informed machine learning</span>—developing methods that incorporate domain expertise to make models more *data-efficient*, *robust*, and *interpretable*. I explore how knowledge can be embedded at different stages of the learning pipeline:  

- **Representation level** – encoding qualitative knowledge into <span style="color:#3a5f8a;">quantitative representations</span> (e.g., signed distance maps).  
- **Architecture level** – embedding knowledge into <span style="color:#3a5f8a;">network design</span> or <span style="color:#3a5f8a;">loss function constraints</span>.  
- **Inference level** – guiding model reasoning with explicit <span style="color:#3a5f8a;">rules</span> during prediction.  

These strategies are particularly relevant under *real-world data challenges* such as **weak supervision**, **scarcity**, and **variability**. My work applies these ideas to domains like <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">healthcare</span>, <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">precision agriculture</span>, and <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">quality analytics in manufacturing</span>.  

She holds a bachelor’s degree in *Information and Industrial Engineering* and a master’s degree in *Industrial Engineering* from **Yonsei University**, where she was advised by <span style="color:#3a5f8a; font-weight:600">Prof. Chang Ouk Kim</span> and conducted research in manufacturing data science. She is also a recipient of the **H. Milton Stewart Fellowship** and the **George Family Fellowship**.  

Outside research, I enjoy playing racquetball 🎾, knitting 🧶, and running 🏃‍♀️—activities that keep me balanced and often refresh my perspective.
