Hello! Thank you for visiting my page.
I am Yeonju Lee, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech, advised by Dr. Jing Li.

My research focuses on knowledge-informed machine learning (ML)â€”approaches that integrate domain knowledge into data-driven models. This paradigm addresses challenges such as data scarcity, high dimensionality, and multi-modal integration, with applications across:
- Healthcare 
- Precision agriculture
- Manufacturing and quality control.

The best way to reach me is via email at ylee845@gatech.edu. I warmly welcome collaborations and discussions related to research.
