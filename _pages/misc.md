  <h3>Personal</h3>
  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing 🎾 racquetball, going for 🏃‍♀️ runs, exploring 🥾 hiking trails around Atlanta, and relaxing with some 🧶 knitting.
    I like getting deeply absorbed in what I do and then taking time to relax and reset. 
    That rhythm of immersion and relaxation gives me good energy and keeps me balanced. 
    It is the same kind of flow I try to bring into my research.
